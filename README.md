## Installation

> :warning: Valet+ requires macOS and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Before installation, you should make sure that no other programs such as Apache or Nginx are binding to your local machine's port 80.

If you have valet or valet+ installed. It is recommended to remove it first:
`composer remove weprovide/valet-plus && rm -rf ~/.valet && rm -rf /usr/local/bin/valet`

1. Install or update [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to the latest version using `brew update`.
3. Add the Homebrew PHP tap for Valet+ via `brew tap henkrehorst/php`.
3. Install PHP 7.4 using Homebrew via `brew install valet-php@7.4`.
4. Install Composer using Homebrew via `brew install composer`.
5. Install Valet+ with Composer via `composer global require marcofaul/valet-plus-reforged`.
6. Add `export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"` to `.bash_profile` (for bash) or `.zshrc` (for zsh) depending on your shell (`echo $SHELL`)
7. Run the `valet fix` command. This will check for common issues preventing Valet+ from installing.
8. Run the `valet install` command. Optionally add `--with-mariadb` to use MariaDB instead of MySQL This will configure and install Valet+ and DnsMasq, and register Valet's daemon to launch when your system starts.
9. Once Valet+ is installed, try pinging (or just visit [http://foobar.test](http://foobar.test) any `*.test` domain on your terminal using a command such as `ping -c1 foobar.test`. If Valet+ is installed correctly you should see this domain responding on `127.0.0.1`. If not you might have to restart your system. Especially when coming from the Dinghy (docker) solution.

> :info: If you get something like "Site can't be reached." Try to change the domain like so
> `valet domain host`
